      Beyond my professional work, I am deeply interested in the intersection of technology and education. I volunteer as a coding instructor for local high school students, aiming to inspire the next generation of software engineers.

      In my free time, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new coffee shops in the city. I am also an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy novels.
